This is a small project to get you familiar with Object Oriented Programming with Ruby.


1. Each lesson consist on:
    - Brief theory
    - Example code (which is building a small app step by step)
    - Task based one examples (which is building *your own* small app step by step)

2. General rules:
    - You can read theory before or after playing with examples
    - In each lesson you should go to correct directory in `examples` and:
        - observe changes in all files
        - run code from `try_it_yourself` file line by line and observe the result (sometimes the result is error and you can expect that it will be solved in next lesson)
    - Files created in each task should be saved in `your_project` directory
